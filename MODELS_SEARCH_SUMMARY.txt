6. CATEGORIZED BY USE CASE:
   - HVAC Control (RL-based)
   - Energy Consumption Prediction
   - Temperature Forecasting
   - Thermal Comfort Prediction
   - Occupancy Detection

MODELS NOT DOWNLOADED - REASONS:

Most pre-trained models were not downloaded locally due to:

1. Repository-Based Distribution:
   - Models stored in GitHub repos requiring full clone
   - Example: dafrie/lstm-load-forecasting (models in /models folder)
   - Solution: Users clone repo to access models

2. No Direct Download Links:
   - Models integrated into training pipelines
   - Requires setup of simulation environment (Sinergym, CityLearn)
   - Example: Stable-Baselines3 agents trained per environment

3. Large File Sizes:
   - Many models exceed 500 MB limit set for this task
   - DRL agents can be 100-500 MB depending on architecture
   - Research-grade models often not published as standalone files

4. Authentication/Setup Required:
   - Some models part of larger frameworks
   - Example: PyThermalComfort is a library, not a pre-trained model
   - Requires environment configuration

5. Data-Dependent:
   - Many models built for specific use cases (Switzerland, US grid, etc.)
   - Performance varies with local building characteristics
   - Training fresh models often preferred to transfer learning

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS FOR USERS:

1. Clone High-Priority Repositories:
   git clone https://github.com/iamirmasoud/energy_consumption_prediction
   git clone https://github.com/INFERLab/Gnu-RL
   git clone https://github.com/dafrie/lstm-load-forecasting

2. Download Real Datasets:
   - Zenodo: Three-Year Building Operations (2.38 GB)
   - HuggingFace: EnergyBench (78K+ buildings)
   - GitHub: Longitudinal Thermal Comfort Dataset

3. Set Up Simulation Environments:
   pip install sinergym
   pip install citylearn
   - Use for training custom RL agents

4. Use Pre-trained Transfer Learning:
   - Thermal comfort models for cold climates
   - Energy consumption LSTM from PJM (US grid) data
   - Fine-tune on your building's data

5. Edge Deployment:

   - PyTorch: Popular in research, used in DRL studies
   - Stable-Baselines3: Standard for building RL control

5. Maturity Levels:
   - Production-ready: PyThermalComfort, CBE Comfort Tool
